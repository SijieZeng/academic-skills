## How to get starting to do research
After you have a general topic and a supervisor, before diving into doing the research, here are some fundamental things that need to be settled down.

First, the frequency of meetings with your supervisors. Make it clear that the assessment committee and the daily supervisor are different, and discuss with your daily supervisor how often will you meet together. Normally, a junior researcher may need a meeting once every two weeks, but it also depends on your schedule and actual situation.

Before each meeting, you must send the manuscript one or two days before the meeting so that your supervisor has enough time to read it and give feedback. You may include the manuscripts and the bullet point that is important in the email. The bullet point may be what you did, what to discuss, and the problem you encountered.

About the bidirectional expectations between you and your supervisor, think about it before the first meeting. You may expect research skills or technical solutions from your supervisor, or you may be a lazy person who just needs somebody to kick your ass. Please put forward your demands and needs to your supervisor and discuss them. Well as for the expectations for you, each professor may have a different understanding of it. For example, the basic requirements maybe - do your best, everyone has their ability but each time we need to challenge ourselves a little bit more. - be honest, if there is a week that you are tired and do not want to do anything, then honestly say it, it is normal that a researcher lacks motivation sometimes. - address the comments, if you have no idea about how to address them, keep thinking and discuss them at the meeting.

The process of the whole research is very important to keep in mind. Before the kick-off meeting, you may need to prepare the research plan which might include an introduction (background, issue/ motivation, stakeholders, literature review), research question (describe the problem, scoping), steps of your master thesis (literature review & how to search literature, what theory you need & how to find and learn it, the needed simulation & what software and how), research methodology (candidate methods, selection, and motivation, expected results), work plan (schedule, 7 months, 40ECs) and organization. Besides, there may be 4 to 5 important meetings of one or two mid-terms to show the progress, a green light meeting to submit the draft report, and a final graduation defense.

### Take my master thesis supervisor as an example
Dr. Andreas Hegyi is the chair of the assessment committee as well as my daily supervisor during my master's thesis. At the first meeting, his expectations of me were (1) to be honest, (2) to do my best, and (3) to respond to the comments. Instead of having specific research goals, such as researching for eight hours every day or achieving results that meet the publication standards of certain journals, my advisor's main objective for me is to cultivate a beginner in research. While these abstract goals may seem easy to achieve, they require one to be very honest with oneself. 

First, "to be honest", one must not only be very honest with the supervisor but also learn to be honest with oneself, acknowledging what one knows and does not know. We need to understand that the research process is precisely about clarifying and understanding an unclear or unfamiliar topic or field. It is entirely normal to encounter areas of uncertainty in this process, so it is crucial to avoid the misconception of having perfectionist expectations of oneself. The role of the supervisor is both to guide and to clarify doubts and to correct the research direction. Maintaining mutual honesty and transparency with the supervisor during the research process is very important. If there is something you don’t understand, just ask directly via email. If personal reasons cause delays during research, you also need to communicate this truthfully with your supervisor to avoid misunderstandings caused by timidity.

Second, "to do my best", what does this mean? Each of us, as a research beginner, has different levels of research proficiency, but regardless of where we start, once we begin a research project, we should achieve some progress and gains. If we only rely on past research experience and stay within our comfort zone, we will not make any progress. Therefore, my supervisor emphasized that I need to challenge my abilities during the research process. For example, in my undergraduate and master's studies, I lacked the skills to extensively search for, skim, and thoroughly read academic papers. Although I took a course on academic research, I remember only scoring a 6. I admit that I always had a vague concept of research—how to start, how to determine the scope of my research, how to write a rigorous academic paper, how to cultivate a scientist’s thinking, and how the entire research process works were all unclear before I began my master's thesis. But with my supervisor’s step-by-step guidance, I took each step seriously, adhering to the principle of doing my best. In the literature review chapter of my formal thesis, the advisor suggested including about 30-40 papers. In my manuscript, I included more than 50 papers, created comprehensive and detailed tables, and categorized and summarized them. Initially, reading the papers I found was exceptionally difficult for me as a beginner, especially the mathematical derivations in the papers. I often lacked the patience to finish a paper and clearly outline its structure, and I felt anxious and worried that the paper might be useless for my research. As someone with mild ADHD, my attention is often distracted by other things. This process of progressing from unfamiliar to familiar with reading literature involves a qualitative change after a quantitative accumulation. I still remember deciding to push myself to thoroughly read a few papers to improve my reading speed when writing the thesis’s literature review chapter. I summarized 2-3 papers in the field according to the categories I thought of. Although it was very slow at first, I gradually found some tricks. Papers in the same field often share some common terminology. For example, one feature I focused on was measurement uncertainties, so I could use Control+F to search for keywords like measurement, detector error, and error throughout the text. I also discovered that key information is often found in the abstract. So I started skimming articles, reading in the order of title, keywords, abstract, figures, and conclusion. If the article is of great interest, I would then read the methodology section in detail.

Third, "to respond to the comments", my supervisor places great importance on whether I respond to his feedback. This not only shows respect for the supervisor’s efforts but also provides an opportunity for me to reflect on how I think about the feedback. My supervisor is very meticulous, even raising objections about the unrealistic half-car image generated by AI on my thesis cover. He would point out every detail, from punctuation to superscripts and subscripts. I consider myself a very careless student and often do not want to re-read and revise my paper once it’s finished. However, I believe it is necessary to re-read my paper, preferably after some time, reading it as if it were someone else’s to find errors, typos or ambiguous expressions. This practice greatly improves the rigor and precision of my writing. I found much of the supervisor’s feedback challenging, often involving critical comments that required significant structural adjustments in the paper, such as the logical order of sections. An interesting discussion we had was about how many pages each chapter should have to meet the workload. I referenced a peer’s thesis where the literature review chapter was 20 pages, so I also wrote 20 pages. The supervisor mentioned reading an excellent thesis that was only 60-70 pages long, demonstrating the author's ability to write concisely and precisely. A longer thesis is not necessarily better; overly long papers might bore the readers, causing them to spend more time reading and less on providing valuable feedback. Thus, precise and concise language expression is very important.

收到feedback后的流程：首先大致浏览，使用zotero打开带有feedback的manuscripts。然后一条一条思考导师的comments，立刻就能修改的typo，可以立即修改并标记绿色表示已处理好。如果对一些comment立刻就有想法，也可以修改后把修改的文章打绿色标级，如果有想法但没有完全修改好，可以把想法写在红色标记里。
最终，你会得到一个list里面包含了绿色和红色的标记，红色的标记可以提取出来作为和导师讨论的内容，进一步确认。
在下一次与导师讨论前，发送有争议或未解决的list，并附上你的想法。
### weekly progress email example
Dear Andreas,

 
Manuscripts: 
1. modifying the manuscripts. 
- LR finished.
- 5.1 measurement function.
 
Weekly progress report: 
- The study progress: I might have ADHD. I went to France for a holiday from 9th, May to 15th, May and went hiking. Visit the town during the daytime and do the manuscript modification at night.
- What I have done: 
1. manuscripts. 
2. thesis LR.
- The plan until Thursday:
Integrate Henk requirements to pdf for the measurement function.
 
- Discuss on Thursday: 
Naming: a Particle Filter-Based Signalized Intersection Queue Estimator (PF-SIQE). In the literature review, I do narrow down to the literature that studies the signalized intersection. OR I wonder if it will be more "general": a Particle Filter-Based Intersection Queue Estimator (PF-IQE), because it is feasible to replace the traffic light decision model with a critical gap merging model (?) for a nonsignalized intersection(?), e.g. model the principle of yielding right in traffic rules. OR a Particle Filter-Based Queue Estimator (PF-QE), which can also used on freeways, e.g. to model the vehicular dynamic of how vehicles respond to the dynamical advice speed limit. I decide to pick (PF-SIQE) to be more consistence with the Literature Review Chapter.

Question 1: there are proportions in decision-making in the dilemma zone, how could this integrate for the particle filter as well as combine the noise in acceleration rate, not simply multiply, right?

Best,
Sijie
## How to draft your research proposal
A research proposal is written when you have an extensive literature review on the topic you plan to go deep into. It is common for the research scope, objective, and research questions in your research proposal to differ from those in your final thesis, especially when you are a beginner in doing research. Learning and gradually accumulating research experience takes time during the entire research process.
